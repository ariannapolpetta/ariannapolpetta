				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;">
                Passionate about innovation.
                <br>
I'm a curious person and I think this is one
of the secrets to success.
<br><br>

Sharing opinions and ideas with others is
essential to me and that's why I like to
work in a team.
<br><br>

I'm a visual design lover and
communicating effectively through a single
image is rewarding.
<br><br>

Moreover, when I fail in something, I don't
see it as a failure but as an invitation not
to give up.
<br><br>

Hobbies;
I love traveling, drawing, music, sport,
baking cakes, and design, in particular
interior design.
<br><br>

It's not my cup of tea;
Discrimination of all kinds, not listening,
and rudeness.</p>
